# What help do I need
- Unit testing, should not be too strict asserting every attribute in the JSOn response because I may refractor the project a little bit
- Performance enhancements, mainly related to database
- There are some TODO
- Security related code, checks, validations

# I do not want contributions on
- Adding completely new features that touch the structure of my JSON responses because I have some client APIs that are expecting to read the JSON as is.
